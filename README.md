# Simple Processor Executor
A library to easily set up and launch processors, mainly for demonstration and testing purposes.
The project contains a `ProcLaunchLib`, which provides the basic functionality to set up the
engine and to process samples in a processor. Furthermore, there are `gain_launcher`, `iir_launcher`
and `fir_launcher`, which are simple command line applications that use the library to process
an audio file with the corresponding processor.
